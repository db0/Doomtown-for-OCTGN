**About the Game**

First of all, lets start with an introduction [From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomtown)

>Doomtown (originally Deadlands:Doomtown) is a collectible card game, a companion to the Deadlands roleplaying setting.

>The game sets itself apart from other CCGs by having each card also serve as a playing card and resolving certain in-game situations with a hand of poker, thus accentuating the Old West atmosphere of the game. The game involves complex deck construction and deep strategies, and was designed with multiplayer (three or more players) in mind. The sheer amount of card draw in the game makes luck much less of a factor, while the movement rules (in the style of board games such as chess) reward intelligent strategy.

>Doomtown was heavily story-driven as well, with a detailed and intriguing storyline that affected cards and play styles. An example was the Fear Level that changed with each expansion and improved or disrupted play styles. Doomtown also held storyline tournaments in which players could directly influence the storyline. For instance, in the finals of a major storyline tournament, Sheriff Coleman was killed by a Sweetrock hired gunman; the sheriff was subsequently killed in the storyline, resulting in new events and action cards, and a later experienced version was Harrowed (revived as a living dead) to avenge his own death.

>As of 2000, Doomtown is officially defunct.

Quite sad indeed. Doomtown is for me one of the most brilliant card games ever designed. It's a sad case that due to licensing, this game cannot be brought back to life, even while the "western" theme is becoming more popular due to recent movies.

One of the great things about Doomtown was indeed how story driven it was and how good the actual storyline was. I wholly suggest that you read [The Big Setup](http://gamesmeister.com/doomtown/viewtopic.php?t=106), which will introduce you to some of the main players in Gommorah and get you in the right mood for the game and if you crave for more, I can't recomment enough the excellent official fiction surrounding the events of the game.
