The Doomtown Card Game arrives in OCTGN. A Brilliant mix of poker, collectible card games and even elements of chess-like tactics, all set in the Weird West (AKA Deadlands) in the boomtown of Gomorra, out in the pacific maze.

Downloading and installing this in OCTGN is not enough, you'll also need to download the [Markers](http://dbzer0.com/pub/Doomtown/markers.o8s) and the [sets](http://octgn.gamersjudgement.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=15).
