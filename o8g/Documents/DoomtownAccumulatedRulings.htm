<P class="p0 ft0">Doomtown Accumulated Rulings Current Version 4.0.6 23rd June 2002</P>
<P class="p1 ft1">This is list of official rulings made on the Deadlands List Server. While there may be a few missing, the vast majority are included in here. If you find any mistakes, are unsure as to the meaning of a ruling, or think that I might have missed one, please send me a telegram to let me know.</P>
<P class="p2 ft3">This is a list of rulings made against cards. For questions about gameplay, please see the <A href="http://www.gamesmeister.com/doomtown/faq.htm"><SPAN class="ft2">FAQ</SPAN></A>. All the rulings have been made by either Dave Williams (Game Designer), Ryan Dancey (original FRPG Big Boss), Ed Bolme (later FRPG Big Boss), Neal Steed or Gerry Crowe (former keepers of the FAQ), or myself, Mat Bowles (current keeper of the FAQ).</P>
<P class="p3 ft4">Blue Text = Changes made since the last version of the Rulings</P>
<P class="p4 ft5">Red Text = Correction or reversal of a previous ruling</P>
<P class="p4 ft3">The rulings are organised into the following categories:</P>
<P class="p5 ft6">Actions</P>
<P class="p6 ft7">A Few Custom Modifications</P>
<P class="p7 ft8">This does not give the Weapon trait to a <NOBR>non-Weapon</NOBR> gadget copying an action from a Weapon.</P>
<P class="p8 ft7">A Secret Tunnel <SPAN class="ft9">- </SPAN><SPAN class="ft8">MRP in Boot Hill</SPAN></P>
<P class="p9 ft11"><SPAN class="ft10">Noon</SPAN>: Target two Deeds you own. A secret tunnel exists between those two Deeds. The Deeds are adjacent whenever you wish for the rest of the game.</P>
<P class="p6 ft7">Ace in the Hole <SPAN class="ft9">- </SPAN><SPAN class="ft8">MRP in Boot Hill</SPAN></P>
<P class="p10 ft11"><SPAN class="ft10">Reaction</SPAN>: Play immediately after Draw hands are revealed for any draw. Discard one card from your Draw hand and replace it with either a card from your Play hand or the top card of your deck.</P>
<P class="p11 ft8">Can be used to add an Event into a lowball hand.</P>
<P class="p12 ft12">Can add a Death's Head Joker to a Draw hand using this card. The Death's Head Joker will detonate after all other reactions to the Draw hand have been played.</P>
<P class="p13 ft8">Can also remove a Death's Head Joker from a shootout Draw hand (only), in which case it doesn't detonate and is simply discarded.</P>
<P class="p8 ft8"><SPAN class="ft7">Ambush </SPAN><SPAN class="ft9">- </SPAN>MRP in Boot Hill</P>
<P class="p14 ft11"><SPAN class="ft10">Noon Job</SPAN>: Boot one of your Dudes to start a job that targets another player's Dude. If the job succeeds, the target Dude is aced (if still in play). All Dudes in your posse become Wanted unless the target was Wanted.</P>
<P class="p15 ft12">If the target becomes wanted during the ambush shootout, this does not prevent the attacking dudes from becoming wanted.</P>
<P class="p4 ft8"><SPAN class="ft7">And Stay Down! </SPAN><SPAN class="ft9">- </SPAN>MRP in Boot Hill</P>
<P class="p16 ft11"><SPAN class="ft10">Reaction</SPAN>: Play immediately before a Harrowed Dude is aced. Target the Dude, who is aced and automatically sent to Boot Hill - no Harrowed pull is made</P>
<P class="p6 ft7">Any One Of Ya! <SPAN class="ft9">- </SPAN><SPAN class="ft8">Errata</SPAN></P>
<P class="p17 ft12"><SPAN class="ft13">Noon</SPAN>: Choose one of your unbooted dudes in town, and move him or her into Town Square, booted. Target another Player who may call your dude out with any dude (even booted dudes and those that normally may not call your dude out) in town he controls, moving him or her to the Town Square. If the player does not, you gain one Victory Point. No other dudes may join this Shootout.</P>
<P class="p18 ft12">You only get a VP if no one calls out your Dude. Winning the subsequent shootout does not give a VP. Only overrides calling out restrictions, not movement restrictions.</P>
<P class="p19 ft8">Your Dude must be able to move to the Town Square for the shootout. Using a card effect that allows you to join posses from an adjacent location without moving is not sufficient.</P>
<P class="p8 ft8"><SPAN class="ft7">Arson </SPAN><SPAN class="ft9">- </SPAN>MRP in Boot Hill</P>
<P class="p20 ft8"><IMG src="DoomtownAccumulatedRulings_images/DoomtownAccumulatedRulings1xi2.jpg" id="inl_img1"><SPAN class="ft9">Noon Job</SPAN>: Boot one of your Dudes to start a job that targets a Deed. If the job succeeds, pull: if the pull is black,</P>

<DIV class="dclr"></DIV>
<P class="p20 ft8"><IMG src="DoomtownAccumulatedRulings_images/DoomtownAccumulatedRulings2xi2.jpg" id="inl_img1"> the Deed is aced and all Dudes in your posse become Wanted.</P>
<P class="p8 ft7">Assault On The Whateleys</P>
<P class="p4 ft8">Dude uniqueness rules apply to the Terror</P>
<P class="p4 ft8">Can be used to play the Werewolf</P>
<P class="p8 ft8"><SPAN class="ft7">Bad Tequila </SPAN><SPAN class="ft9">- </SPAN>MRP in Boot Hill</P>
<P class="p20 ft8"><IMG src="DoomtownAccumulatedRulings_images/DoomtownAccumulatedRulings2xi3.jpg" id="inl_img2"><SPAN class="ft9">Noon</SPAN>: Target an unbooted Dude with Influence less than 2. Boot the Dude.</P>
<P class="p8 ft7">Between The Shoulderblades</P>
<P class="p21 ft8">Only card effects that say they remove a Dude count. Yes, that does include Medicine and Helping Hands, but wouldn't include a Harrowed pull which is not a card effect.</P>
<P class="p8 ft7">Bloody Face</P>
<P class="p22 ft8">If a Dude targeted with this then attaches a Harrowed Power, the Harrowed Power is permanent, even though the effect of Bloody Face expires at Nightfall</P>
<P class="p23 ft8">This only allows the Dude to be <SPAN class="ft9">targeted </SPAN>as though he were a Harrowed - it does not actually make the Dude harrowed.</P>
<P class="p8 ft7">Bluff</P>
<P class="p23 ft8">If this results in an illegal hand, your opponent cannot play a Cheatin' card as the time to play those has passed (For a more detailed explanation, see the <A href="Reactions"><SPAN class="ft14">FAQ - Reactions</SPAN></A>)</P>
<P class="p4 ft8">You cannot play this unless you have a Draw hand of your own.</P>
<P class="p8 ft7">Born Under A Strange Star</P>
<P class="p4 ft8">If the Dude hits Boot Hill again, you can still bring another copy into play.</P>
<P class="p8 ft7">Both Barrels</P>
<P class="p4 ft8">Complete the first hand, including all extra cards and redraws, then draw the second.</P>
<P class="p8 ft7">Bottom Dealin'</P>
<P class="p24 ft12">Draw the top card of your Discard pile before discarding this card. <SPAN class="ft15">Bounty Hunter </SPAN><SPAN class="ft13">- </SPAN>MRP in Boot Hill</P>
<P class="p25 ft12"><SPAN class="ft13">Noon</SPAN>: Target a Wanted Dude. A Bounty Hunter enters play at the Dude's location and calls out the Dude, who cannot refuse. The Bounty Hunter is a <NOBR>2-Stud,</NOBR> 0 Influence, ace value token Dude. Remove the token Dude from play after the shootout.</P>
<P class="p26 ft12">He can target dudes at restricted locations, such as the Abandoned Mine, as he come's into play there rather than moving there.</P>
<P class="p27 ft11">Can be cancelled with Sheriff's Watchin' <SPAN class="ft16">Brawl </SPAN><SPAN class="ft10">- </SPAN>MRP in Pine Box + Errata</P>
<P class="p28 ft12"><SPAN class="ft13">Noon: </SPAN>Target any location. Until after nightfall, any dude in that location can as a <SPAN class="ft13">Noon </SPAN>action start a Shootout with any other dude at that location. This is not "Calling Out". Any dude aced as a result of the Shootout goes home booted instead of being aced. Normal shootouts at this location resolve normally.</P>
<P class="p29 ft12">Only Dudes declared as casualties after comparing Draw hands are sent home booted. Dudes aced at other times during the Brawl, for example with a Shotgun, are aced and sent to Boot Hill.</P>
<P class="p30 ft12">A Dude can start as many Brawls as he wants in a turn at the selected location. If an Unlucky Charm is played on a Dude in a Brawl, he can be aced as normal.</P>
<P class="p13 ft8">Effects that prevent Dudes from not being aced override Brawl. So Deputy John Templeton aces any Dude he defeats in a Brawl. Same goes for the Sioux Spirit Warriors.</P>
<P class="p4 ft8"><SPAN class="ft7">Bucket Brigade </SPAN><SPAN class="ft9">- </SPAN>MRP in Boot Hill</P>
<P class="p31 ft11"><SPAN class="ft10">Reaction</SPAN>: Play immediately before a Deed is aced. The Deed is not aced, but actions on the Deed cannot be used for the rest of this turn and the Deed produces no ghost rock until after Nightfall next turn.</P>
<P class="p6 ft8"><SPAN class="ft7">Bum Rush </SPAN><SPAN class="ft9">- </SPAN>MRP in Boot Hill</P>
<P class="p9 ft11"><SPAN class="ft10">Shootout</SPAN>: Target one of your Dudes in this shootout. The Dude gains a +1 Bullet bonus until the end of the shootout. Only one Bum Rush can be played per shootout.</P>
<P class="p6 ft8"><SPAN class="ft7">Burn 'Em Down </SPAN><SPAN class="ft9">- </SPAN>MRP in Boot Hill</P>
<P class="p32 ft11"><SPAN class="ft10">Shootout</SPAN>: Target a Dude in the opposing posse. Boot one of your Dudes in this shootout to reduce the targets Bullet rating by an amount equal to your Dude's Bullet rating until the end of the shootout.</P>

<P class="p8 ft7">Caught With Yer Pants Down</P>
<P class="p33 ft12">Collegium New Front dudes hit with this gain no benefit from attached gadgets, and so will not get a VP for acing a Stud.</P>
<P class="p34 ft11">Takes precedence over the Ammo Belt <SPAN class="ft16">Claim Jumper </SPAN><SPAN class="ft10">- </SPAN>MRP in Boot Hill</P>
<P class="p35 ft11"><SPAN class="ft10">Noon</SPAN>: Target a Strike you control. Boot one of your Dudes at the Strike to become the owner of the Strike until it leaves play. If the Strike leaves play, ownership immediately returns to its original owner.</P>
<P class="p36 ft11">You may Claim Jump a copy of a <NOBR>non-unique</NOBR> claim that you already have in play <SPAN class="ft17">Clean Getaway</SPAN></P>
<P class="p4 ft18">You must move to another out of town location. If you cannot, you cannot play the card.</P>
