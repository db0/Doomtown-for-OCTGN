<P class="p22 ft16">Deeds</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>What is a deed?</P>
<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>A deed is a location other then a player's home, or the Town Square.</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>And a strike?</P>
<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>A strike is a deed that is almost always found out of town. (The Lode is an exception.)</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Ok smart guy, what's the real difference?</P>
<P class="p31 ft7"><SPAN class="ft18">A: </SPAN>All deeds that aren't labelled "Strike" or "Out Of Town" are <NOBR>in-town,</NOBR> and are therefore adjacent to the Town Square.</P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>And what about this Public and Private stuff?</P>
<P class="p33 ft20"><SPAN class="ft19">A: </SPAN>While different parts of Gomorra are owned by different outfits, there’s usually nothing to stop you wandering into one of your opponent’s deeds. However sometimes you ain't really welcome there. If you’re ever at a Private location that you don't own, and a shootout starts, any dudes in your posse become wanted the moment they join your posse (even if you didn't start</P>

<P class="p0 ft2">the shootin'!)</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Right, got that. Now, what's the difference between owning and controlling?</P>
<P class="p35 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>The owner is the player who put the deed/strike in play, and this won't usually change (unless a card specifically allows it). The controller is the person with the most Influence at that location, and this likely to change a lot durin' the game as player's vie for control o' Deeds. If there is a tie in Influence, including a tie of zero, the owner is also the controller (even if he has no Dudes there). For more info on this, see <A href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041026234032/http://www.gamesmeister.com/doomtown/faq.htm#Controllin'%20Cards"><SPAN class="ft21">Controllin' Cards</SPAN></A></P>
<P class="p36 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Suppose the upkeep on a deed is zero or positive. Can I decide not to receive it and let it go to the discard pile?</P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>No you can't.</P>
<P class="p37 ft25"><SPAN class="ft24">Q: Production Modifiers </SPAN>- I am a new accountant for Sweetrock Mining Co., and I've run into a spot of difficulty that someone may be able to clear up for me. It seems that the IRS wants to know what the production was at the Spirit of Kentucky Shaft last quarter, and I've not been able to get an answer from Mr. Findley's office. Thus, I am forced to calculate it myself.</P>
<P class="p0 ft2">Here is the situation:</P>
<P class="p38 ft27">The base production at the Spirit of Kentucky (S of K) shaft is 3 GR / quarter. In the previous quarter, I know that the company had Max Baine order <SPAN class="ft26">Double Time </SPAN>for all workers at the S of K Shaft, effectively doubling their output for last quarter. Of course, just knowing the great <SPAN class="ft26">Howard Findley </SPAN>is leading our great company inspires the workers and increases their production each quarter by 1. Furthermore, Mr. Findley chose to supplement the workforce at the S of K with those loveable waifs from the <SPAN class="ft26">Orphanage</SPAN>, again doubling last quarter's production. <SPAN class="ft26">Overtime </SPAN>was announced for all mines at the beginning of the quarter, increasing their production by 1. Finally, since <SPAN class="ft26">Robert Northrop </SPAN>is present at the strike, the production is doubled. What's the final production for the S of K Shaft?</P>
<P class="p39 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Unless the card specifically states to apply it's bonus before or after other modifiers (e.g. Orphanage), apply them in the following order...</P>
<P class="p40 ft2"><SPAN class="ft27">1)</SPAN><SPAN class="ft28">Any modifiers that specify "Printed" production are applied first. e.g. Labor Dispute</SPAN></P>
<P class="p40 ft2"><SPAN class="ft27">2)</SPAN><SPAN class="ft29">Then apply any other modifiers to a Deed's Production e.g. Double Time</SPAN></P>
<P class="p22 ft17">In both cases, apply Addition and Subtraction first, then Multiplication and Division.</P>
<P class="p41 ft20">So in the example above, the only card that affects printed production is Robert, so he doubles the production to 6. Next we do the additions for the other cards (Findley and Overtime), to take it to 8. Then we do the multiplication for Double Time, to take it to 16. Finally, as stated on the card, the Orphanage is applied after all other bonuses, so that takes the total to 32.</P>
<P class="p42 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>What if two or more effect double the "Printed" production of a Deed? How can the Printed production change anyway?</P>
<P class="p43 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>You're right, in fact it doesn't. When an effect says to double printed production, it's actually shorthand for "Increase the production of this Deed by it's printed production". So if a Deed has production of 3, and has two effects played on it that both double printed production, the first effect would increase it's production by 3 to 6, and the other would increase its production by another 3 to 9.</P>

</DIV>
<DIV id="id_2">
<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Are Goods Unique?</P>
</DIV>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_4">


<P class="p45 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Not unless the Goods card states it. There are a few unique Goods, found in some of the expansion sets, so you can't play another of these if there's already a copy in play or in Boot Hill. But there's no such limit on other Goods cards.</P>
<P class="p46 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>If I have a dude with a Draw Bullet rating, and I give him a weapon with a Stud Bullet, how does that change his Bullet rating? Is he a Draw or a Stud?</P>
<P class="p47 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Goods with Bullet modifiers modify your Dude's Bullets - ignore the color on the Goods. So if your Dude is a 2 Stud, and you give him a weapon with a +2 Draw Bullet, he becomes a 4 Stud dude.</P>
<P class="p46 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Can you move a gadget from a mad scientist to someone who is not a mad scientist. e.g. can I give T.C. a Ray Gun after Erik Zarkov creates it?</P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>Yes.</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Do I need anyone special to bring <SPAN class="ft17">Mystical goods </SPAN>into play?</P>
<P class="p48 ft20"><SPAN class="ft19">A: </SPAN>Not unless another trait of the goods card requires it. (i.e. If there were a mystical gadget you would need a mad scientist.) Mystical goods in and of themselves do not require anyone special.</P>
<P class="p35 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Can I unready the only weapon on a dude? For example if Josef Nicolai Rocescu was about to take on a Maze Dragon, and wanted to unready his Winchester</P>
<P class="p49 ft30"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Nope, this one changed as of Boot Hill. You can't unready a weapon if you don't have another weapon to ready in its place.</P>
<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Can more than one dude trade Goods as part of a single action?</P>
<P class="p50 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Yes. So long as you all the dudes are in the same location, and you control it, those dudes trade any number of Goods between them as a single action. In fact, just to make it easy, here's a clarification on the rules for trading Goods...</P>
<P class="p51 ft2"><SPAN class="ft2">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft31">The dude giving the Goods can be booted or unbooted.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p52 ft2"><SPAN class="ft2">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft31">The dude receiving the Goods must be unbooted.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p52 ft2"><SPAN class="ft2">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft31">Both dudes must be in the same location, under your control.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p53 ft2"><SPAN class="ft2">•</SPAN><SPAN class="ft31">A dude can give more than one Goods in a single trade</SPAN></P>
<P class="p40 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q:</SPAN><SPAN class="ft29">Do I need to have a ready Weapon to attach a Bullet card.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>Nope, not unless the Bullet card says so (such as the Reckoners Bullet).</P>

<P class="p27 ft16">Events</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>I've heard about this new headline rule, can you tell me what it's about?</P>
<P class="p55 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Sure. It was felt by the design team that Events were becoming a bit too overpowering, and it was decided to reduce their impact on the game a little. What this means is that each player can now only resolve one Event per day. If a player has two or more Events appear in his or her lowball Draw hand, pass them face down to an opponent who randomly selects one - this Event resolves while all others are discarded without effect.</P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Hang on, you said discarded. What if my Event would normally ace itself?</P>
<P class="p56 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Doesn't matter. No part of the Event's text resolves, so it just goes straight into your Discard pile.</P>
<P class="p57 ft33"><SPAN class="ft32">Q: </SPAN>What about effects that cancel or delay events? <SPAN class="ft32">A: </SPAN>They are resolved after the event is selected.</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Do all Events go to boot hill?</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_5">


<P class="p58 ft7"><SPAN class="ft18">A: </SPAN>Events that ace themselves tell you do so. All cards that are aced go to Boot Hill. An Event that doesn't ace itself goes back into your Discard pile.</P>
<P class="p59 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>If I reveal a lowball hand with Events, and then use a card to redraw my lowball hand, what happens to those Events?</P>
<P class="p60 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Nothing. Only one Event in the <SPAN class="ft22">final </SPAN>revealed draw hand will take effect, regardless of how that hand was achieved.</P>
<P class="p61 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>If I've got Events in my lowball hand, can I choose not to have them resolve? <SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>No.</P>

<P class="p27 ft16">Actions</P>
<P class="p27 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>What is an action, anyway?</P>
<P class="p62 ft20"><SPAN class="ft19">A: </SPAN>Actions are card effects that begin with "Noon", "Reaction", or "Shootout". As a matter of fact, Movin', Callin' Out, Shoppin' and Tradin' are also considered Noon Actions, but we're not concerned with them right now - we'll just talk about actions on cards..</P>
<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>So how often can I perform these actions?</P>
<P class="p63 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>Action cards from your Play hand can be played at the times the cards specify. So for example, if you have 3 copies of the "Sun In Yer Eyes" shootout action in your Play hand, you can play all 3 during a shootout if you so wish. Actions printed on cards in play can <SPAN class="ft34">only </SPAN>be performed once per turn, unless the card specifically says otherwise. That means that you've got to be careful when you use an Action like the Ranger’s movement action, or Tao Cheng's Bullet Bonus action. Pick your time carefully.</P>
<P class="p64 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Sure, but I've got this Dude with a reaction effect - that means I can use that every time the reaction's triggered, right?</P>
<P class="p65 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Nope. Many folks don't realise this when they first start playing, but reactions are a type of action, and so can still only be used once per turn.</P>
<P class="p56 ft25"><SPAN class="ft24">Q: </SPAN>How long do shootout actions last? I had someone tell me that actions which target a dude, such as "Out of Ammo", last the entire shootout even if it goes past the first draw hand.</P>
<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>Unless a card says "for this round of the shootout", it's effects last the entire shootout.</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>I don't understand what the picture on the Action card background is.</P>
<P class="p66 ft20"><SPAN class="ft19">A: </SPAN>It's the "Action" of a rifle. It's a bad visual pun by the graphic designer, Al Skaar (I kid you not) who was featured as One Eyed Al the Barber on the original Episodes 1&2 display box.</P>

<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Can I give a spell to a booted Dude</P>
<P class="p67 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>No, he must be unbooted to attach it unless you're using a card effect to attach it.</P>
<P class="p68 ft20"><SPAN class="ft19">Q: </SPAN>Ok, but what if the spell is already attached. Can my Dude still use if he’s booted? <SPAN class="ft19">A: </SPAN>Yes he can, but only if the spell does not require the Dude to boot when casting it.</P>
<P class="p69 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Can I swap spells between Dudes? Does it work like swapping goods? <SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>No, spells can’t be traded.</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Can my Dude cast multiple spells during the same turn?</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_6">


<P class="p70 ft7"><SPAN class="ft18">A: </SPAN>Yes, but each <SPAN class="ft18">spell card </SPAN>can only be used once per turn, even if it has more than one spell on it.</P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Can I put multiple copies of the same spell on a Dude to make it easier to cast.</P>
<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>No. Two Soul Blasts means he can Soul Blast twice. It doesn't reduce the difficulty.</P>
<P class="p71 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>If I have no cards left in my deck and Discard pile, is a spell pull automatically successful? Does it automatically fail?</P>
<P class="p72 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>No to both. For a skill check, you add the pull to the skill level, and if the total is greater than the difficulty, the spell's successful. If there is no pull, add zero to the skill level. You could still succeed at a simple spell, if your skill level is high enough.</P>

<P class="p77 ft7"><SPAN class="ft18">A: </SPAN>Cards that have changed ownership always revert back to their original owner when they leave play.</P>

<P class="p78 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>If a card allows you to get a card from your deck, does that include your Discard Pile? <SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>No.</P>
<P class="p79 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q</SPAN>: If an effect allows me to search my deck for a card, and it doesn't say I have to show the card to my opponents, do I have to?</P>
<P class="p80 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A</SPAN>: The short answer is no. But...in a tournament, the other players are perfectly within their rights to have a judge ensure that the card selected was a valid one.</P>
<P class="p81 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Can anyone look through anyone's discard pile at any time? <SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>No.</P>
<P class="p82 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q</SPAN>: When I discard cards, can I discard them as a block so my opponent only gets to see the top one?</P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A</SPAN>: No. Whenever you discard cards, your opponents are entitled to see them.</P>
<P class="p83 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>When do I shuffle my Discard to make a "new" deck? Is it when my deck is down to 0 cards, or is it the first time I need to Draw or Pull?</P>
<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>The first time you need to Draw or Pull</P>
<P class="p30 ft12"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>What if a card allows me to look at the top card of my deck?</P>
<P class="p84 ft36"><SPAN class="ft35">A: </SPAN>Shuffle, then look. If you are allowed to look at more cards then you have left, shuffle your discard pile up and place your remaining deck on top, then look.</P>
<P class="p85 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>If I have a Dude in Boot Hill who has never been in play, but was put there via the <SPAN class="ft37">Stagecoach Office </SPAN>for example, is he treated any different than a Dude who was gunned down in a shootout at High Noon?</P>
<P class="p86 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A</SPAN>: Nope. Once a card has been aced and sent to Boot Hill, it is then treated the same as any other card in Boot Hill. So if the card in Boot Hill is a Dude, he can be affected by any card that targets a dude in Boot Hill, such as <SPAN class="ft37">Hells Fury</SPAN>. A Gadget can be retrieved by <SPAN class="ft37">Robert Holmes</SPAN>, etc.</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>How many Boot Hills are there in this town anyway?</P>
<P class="p87 ft7"><SPAN class="ft18">A: </SPAN>Actually there's only one. Each player has his or her own Boot Hill pile, but all piles are considered part of the same Boot Hill.</P>
<P class="p88 ft25"><SPAN class="ft24">Q: </SPAN>I played a game the other day where I had no cards left in my deck and only 3 left in my discard pile. I got into a shootout and had to make a draw hand - what happens now?</P>
<P class="p43 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Just draw as many cards as possible, in this case 3, and make the best hand you can.Don't forget that to make a straight or flush requires 5 cards in the Draw hand, so you won't be able to make those.</P>
<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Do I discard face up or face down? And can I ever search through my discard pile.</P>
<P class="p50 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>You always discard face up, but you can never search through any discard pile without a card effect that allows you to do it.</P>
<P class="p89 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Right, now I've got this card that lets me search through my discard pile. Does that include my deck as well?</P>
<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>Nope! If a card doesn't specifically allow you to search your deck, then you can't.</P>

<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Does it matter who controls or owns a Deed?</P>
<P class="p55 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>You bet it does. Some deeds have special abilities which are usually prefaced by the word controller. If this is the case whoever controls the deed can perform the ability. Any ability on a deed, which does not specify owner, can only be performed by the controller. However, the owner is the only one who can collect Ghostrock from a deed and even then only if they are also the controller. If a deed has a different owner and controller, nobody collects the production, and nobody has to pay the Upkeep. Finally, the controller is the one who receives any Control Points from the deed.</P>
<P class="p91 ft20"><SPAN class="ft19">Q: </SPAN>So if I control a deed owned by my opponent, it produces no ghostrock, right? <SPAN class="ft19">A: </SPAN>Wrong, its production doesn't change, it's just that nobody collects the ghostrock.</P>
<P class="p92 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Can you ever control the town square? <SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>No, never.</P>
<P class="p93 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Can control of a Deed change in the middle of a job or shootout? <SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Sure. Control of a Deed can change at ANY point.</P>
<P class="p94 ft25"><SPAN class="ft24">Q: </SPAN>Let's say I control a Deed, and it has a Controller reaction that I can play when a Dude gets aced. e.g. <SPAN class="ft38">The Good Doctor</SPAN>. If all my dudes there get aced as a result of a shootout draw - do I lose control of the Doc's as soon as they were aced, or do I keep control until they hit boot hill? <SPAN class="ft24">A: </SPAN>Although your dudes are aced they haven't left the location yet (they're about to). You still control it and can still use the reaction to try and save one of your Dudes.</P>
<P class="p95 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>If I take control of another player's Dude for a turn, and he gets sent home booted, whose home does he go to?</P>
<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>He goes to yours i.e. the Controller's.</P>
<P class="p96 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>I managed to take control of my opponent's Dude, who then got aced in a shootout. Whose Boot Hill pile does he go to?</P>
<P class="p97 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Whenever you control another player's card and that card leaves play, it always returns to it's real owner. So it goes in your opponent's Boot Hill.</P>

<P class="p99 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Two players reveal their Lowball hands. Both wish to play reactions...who gets to play first? <SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>There isn't a new winner until the lowball is done. Whoever won lowball last turn is still The Winner and would play first.</P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Who plays reactions first on the very first hand of <NOBR>Low-ball?</NOBR></P>
<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>I have to admit there's no rule for this. I would say determine randomly in this case.</P>
<P class="p39 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>If there are pulls to be made during Lowball, for example with Easter Sunday, who pulls first?</P>
<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>The winner of this lowball round</P>
<P class="p100 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>It says in the rulebook that if you don't have five cards left to draw, your Draw hand's considered the lowest possible. What does that mean?</P>
<P class="p101 ft20"><SPAN class="ft19">A: </SPAN>If you've got cards in your discard pile, just shuffle 'em up as normal to make your new deck. If you still haven't got enough cards left after shufflin' up your discard pile, then just make the</P>

<P class="p0 ft2">worst hand you can with the cards you have left.</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>What do you mean by the worst possible hand?</P>
<P class="p55 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>I mean take the cards you have in your hand, and add 'phantom cards' to the Draw hand to make it as bad as possible. For example, let say you only have 2 cards left in your entire deck and discard pile - a 9H and a 10C. In this case, you can potentially have a 4 of a kind (4 10's), so that's considered to be your lowball hand.</P>

<P class="p102 ft20"><SPAN class="ft19">Q: </SPAN>Do I have to pay the Upkeep cost of all my cards that I both own and control? <SPAN class="ft19">A: </SPAN>No. You may choose not to pay, in which case the card is discarded.</P>
<P class="p103 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>What about if the card has zero Upkeep, or has Production instead. Can I choose to forfeit the production and discard the card?</P>
<P class="p0 ft17">A: <SPAN class="ft2">No</SPAN></P>
<P class="p104 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>I've just put a Dude from another outfit into play, so I have to pay the additional Upkeep cost. If I then use a card to increase that Dude's Influence, does his Upkeep cost go up as well? <SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>Yes. When calculating additional Upkeep due to Influence, use the Dude's total Influence. <SPAN class="ft12">The additional upkeep cost only applies during lowball, and not for other card effects such as Insurance Policy.</SPAN></P>

<P class="p106 ft40">Shoppin'</P>
<P class="p107 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>I've got 2 ghostrock left in my vault, and I decide to play a <SPAN class="ft41">New Hat</SPAN>, with a cost of 2. My opponent then plays a reaction to raise the cost of my Hat to 3. What happens next?</P>
<P class="p108 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>To play a card (or perform an action), you must be able to pay all costs involved in playing the cost (or action). If the cost changes, then you may continue trying to pay the cost. If you are unable to pay the full cost or reduce the cost back down again, the card does not enter play (the action is cancelled) and any partial costs that have already been paid (ghostrock, booting dudes, etc) are lost and not returned. So in your case, the <SPAN class="ft37">New Hat </SPAN>remains in your hand and ghostrock you paid is gone.</P>
<P class="p109 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>I've got a card that says its cost can't be reduced. What about another effect that brings the card in for free - can I play that instead</P>
<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>Nope, making it free is definitely reducing the cost.</P>
<P class="p110 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Someone's just played a card on me that's cancelled my shoppin' action...what happens to the card and ghostrock paid?</P>
<P class="p111 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>If you change the cost of a Goods so the player can't afford it, he loses what he's paid so far, but the Goods remains in his hand. I'd say if you cancel a shoppin' action, it should follow the same rule to keep it simple. Costs would remain paid, but the shoppin' action has no effect so the Goods doesn't enter play. Therefore it stays in your hand.</P>

<P class="p112 ft43"><SPAN class="ft42">A: </SPAN>Yes, it will allow you to attach a card to a booted dude, even in a location you cannot control. It does not allow you to attach cards the dude could not normally attach.</P>

<P class="p22 ft40">Movin'</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>I can't figure out how Movement works. Please help!</P>
<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>It's real simple. You <SPAN class="ft17">always </SPAN>boot your dude when you move...</P>
<P class="p27 ft2">...With 2 simple exceptions:</P>
<P class="p113 ft2"><SPAN class="ft27">1.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft29">If you're moving a Dude from your </SPAN><SPAN class="ft17">own </SPAN>Home to an adjacent location.</P>
<P class="p114 ft23"><SPAN class="ft27">2.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft44">If you're moving a Dude from the Town square to an adjacent location except your </SPAN><SPAN class="ft22">own </SPAN>Home - if you wish to move there, you must boot.</P>
<P class="p115 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Wait a minute! What about when I'm at a Deed and I want to move to an adjacent Deed? <SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>You boot when you move. Adjacency is mostly important for figuring out who can join a Posse in a Shootout or to do a Job. It has little to do with movement.</P>
<P class="p116 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>So I don’t boot when moving out of my own home to an adjacent location, but I do boot when moving out of yours, right?</P>
<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>Correct</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Can I move to an <NOBR>out-of-town</NOBR> Deed without going through the Town Square?</P>
<P class="p117 ft7"><SPAN class="ft18">A: </SPAN>Sure. In fact, there is no reason whatsoever to go via the Town Square when you're moving out of town.</P>
<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Those chickens keep holin' up in their home, can I go in and call them out?</P>
<P class="p117 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Well, you can move into your opponent's home at any time, but you can't call his dudes out without a card effect.</P>
<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>If a card lets me move to a new location, do I still have to boot.</P>
<P class="p67 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>No. When moving via a card effect, your dude only boots if the card tells him to.</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Some Deeds only let me move to them by using a card effect. What does this mean?</P>
<P class="p55 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Moving via a card effect means using an effect that actually moves the dude. For example the Rocket Pack says "Noon: Boot the Pack to move this dude to a different location". Don't get confused with card effects that alter the way you move though. For example, the Roan does not have an effect that moves a dude - it just says that if your dude is moving and happens to boot in the process, the Roan is booted instead of the dude. That is not a card effect that moves your dude.</P>
<P class="p118 ft45">The Rocket Pack will get out to the Sweetrock Western Corporate Office startin' Strike, the Roan won't.</P>
<P class="p119 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>I boot to move a Dude, but my opponent plays an action that cancels my movement <SPAN class="ft43">or redirects me</SPAN>. Does my Dude remain booted?</P>
<P class="p120 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Yes. Booting is a cost of moving, and all costs remain paid after an action is cancelled. <SPAN class="ft43">You also remain booted if you are redirected to a location you would not have booted to move to, and do not need to boot if you are redirected to a location where you would have needed to. Booting is a cost, not an effect, of movement.</SPAN></P>

<P class="p121 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>You used to have to control a location to attach Goods using a card effect. Has that changed now?</P>
<P class="p122 ft20"><SPAN class="ft19">A: </SPAN>It sure has! You can now attach a Goods to a Dude using a card effect even if the Dude doesn't control his or her location, and even if the Dude's booted. This is to make the Tradin' rules consistent with the other standard Noon actions (Shoppin', Movin', and Callin' Out).</P>
<P class="p0 ft12"><SPAN class="ft46">Q: </SPAN>Can you trade a goods that has already been used that turn (like the still)</P>

<P class="p125 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Simple really, any of your unbooted Dudes at the same location as another player’s Dude may "call out" the opposing Dude.</P>
<P class="p67 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Ok so what happens if I call someone out?</P>
<P class="p126 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Depends on the opposin' Dude's guts. He can either accept the challenge, or run like a dog to his home. Of course, sometimes a Dude can be a bit tired and can't run at all, this happens if the Dude bein' called out is booted.</P>
<P class="p127 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Does calling someone out boot my Dude? <SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Nope, kinda scary huh.</P>
<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Can I call out my own Dudes?</P>
<P class="p128 ft7"><SPAN class="ft18">A: </SPAN>No way, and nor can you target your own Dudes with Jobs, before you go gettin’ any funny ideas. <SPAN class="ft36">Not even with a card effect that does not say opposing; it doesn't need to.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Can I call out my opponent’s Dude who’s sitting at home?</P>
<P class="p129 ft20"><SPAN class="ft19">A: </SPAN>You can, but only by using a card effect. There are many cards that let you call a Dude out or start a shootout with a Dude, and you must use one of them to call out a Dude in his home.</P>
<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>What's the difference between calling someone out, and starting a shootout with them?</P>
<P class="p130 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>The defending Dude may refuse if called out, and run home booted. But if a card effect starts a shootout, that defending Dude cannot refuse.</P>
<P class="p131 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>My Dude is already at home, and I want to refuse a calling out. Can I do that? <SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>Yes, you just remain at home booted.</P>
<P class="p67 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Right, got all that, now what happens if they accept?</P>
<P class="p89 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Both players form a posse. For a Dude to join the posse, the Dude must belong to that player’s gang, and be in: a) the targets location, or b) adjacent to the targets location. Dudes in adjacent locations must boot to join a posse.</P>
<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>When creating posses, what's the order for adding people?</P>
<P class="p132 ft7"><SPAN class="ft18">A: </SPAN>The Dealer adds whichever Dudes he wishes to his posse, then the Target does the same. The Dealer always tips his hand and reveals his Shooter first.</P>
<P class="p133 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>If I get into a shootout at another player's Private Deed, at what point do my Dudes become Wanted?</P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>As soon as they join your posse, they immediately become Wanted.</P>

<P class="p136 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>I've got this card that says I must ace a Dude to get an effect. Can I save the Dude after I've aced him?</P>
<P class="p137 ft48"><SPAN class="ft47">A: </SPAN>Good question, which boils down to whether acing the Dude is a cost or not. If the card reads: "Do X. Gain Y", then doing X is <SPAN class="ft47">not </SPAN>a cost of gaining Y.</P>
<P class="p0 ft2">If the card reads: "Do X to gain Y", then doing X <SPAN class="ft17">is </SPAN>considered a cost.</P>
<P class="p138 ft23">Example 1: Undead Miners reads "Ace one of your Strikes. Target another one of your Strikes. The target Strike has it’s printed Production permanently doubled". In this case, if you save the strike with a Bucket Brigade, you still the double the other strikes production because acing the first strike is not a cost.</P>
<P class="p139 ft23">Example 2: Nasty Docs reads "Boot Doc's and ace any <NOBR>non-Terror</NOBR> Dude you control to Harrow a dude who has just been aced." Note the difference - this time, acing the <NOBR>non-Terror</NOBR> Dude is a cost of harrowing the <NOBR>just-aced</NOBR> Dude.

<P class="p27 ft39">4. Nightfall</P>
<P class="p149 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Do I have to draw back up to my maximum hand size during Nightfall? <SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Yes</P>
<P class="p150 ft40">Winnin' the Game</P>
<P class="p151 ft53">Shootouts</P>
<P class="p152 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>My Dude is already at home, and I want to chicken out of a shootout. Can I do that?</P>
<P class="p128 ft7"><SPAN class="ft18">A: </SPAN>Yes. If you chicken out of a shootout at your home, you just remain at home but outside the shootout.</P>
<P class="p85 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q</SPAN>: One of my dudes has a Shootout action printed on him. Does he have to be in the Shootout to use this action?</P>
<P class="p153 ft7"><SPAN class="ft18">A</SPAN>: Yes he does, with one exception. If the purpose of the action is to move the dude into the Shootout, then he can use it to join the posse.</P>
<P class="p35 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>My opponent has a card that sends my dude home booted. If he plays this during a shootout at my home, does my dude continue to take part in the Shootout?</P>
<P class="p154 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>No, any card that sends a dude home booted automatically removes him from any shootout he's in. He’ll remain at home, booted, but out of the shootout.</P>
<P class="p155 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>When doing the shootout do you keep going after the first Draw, or does the shootout only end when one side either chickens out or is aced?</P>
<P class="p133 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>The shootout ends when there is no opposing Posse. If everyone boots to run home, there's no more Posse. If all the Dudes in the Posse are dead, there's no more Posse. Otherwise, you're standin' in and lettin' the lead fly, pardner! <SPAN class="ft43">If the location of the shootout is discarded, the shootout ends without resolution, and all dudes in both posses go home booted.. eg. Jackelope Stampede or Foreclosure.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p156 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Can booted dudes be your primary shooter? <SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Yup.</P>
<P class="p157 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q</SPAN>: I've seen some cards that start a shootout in the middle of another shootout, such as Rooftop Sniper. My question is, do shootout effects from the original shootout carry over into this new one? For example, if my Dude had increased his Bullet rating by +1 during the initial shootout, and then he suddenly finds himself in the middle of another, does he keep his increased Bullet rating in this one too?</P>
<P class="p158 ft7"><SPAN class="ft18">A</SPAN>: No. Any card effects played during the original shootout never carry over into the new one, even though the original shootout hasn't even finished yet.</P>
<P class="p159 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>I've got one Dude in my posse, and my opponent uses a shootout action to send him home, out of the shootout. Can I use my next shootout action to bring another of my Dudes into the fray, using an action on the Dude's card.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_14">


<P class="p160 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Nope, 'fraid not. As soon as your initial Dude leaves the shootout, you don't have a posse, and as soon as that happens, the shootout ends. Just in case it matters, your opponent is considered the winner of the shootout in this situation.</P>
<P class="p161 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>I've got a card that does something when I win a shootout. Exactly when am I considered to have 'won a shootout'.</P>
<P class="p162 ft7"><SPAN class="ft18">A: </SPAN>When you have the only surviving posse in a shootout, you win. Even if you just send all the opposing Dudes home, you are still considered to have won the shootout.</P>
<P class="p163 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>My opponent has got this card that says "Card effects cannot prevent opposing Dudes from being aced in this shootout." Can I still use an effect that lowers the number of casualties I take. <SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Sure, that's a different card effect.</P>
<P class="p164 ft43"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>My opponent plays a card effect that prevents one of my dudes from contributing to the number of cards drawn or redrawn. What does this mean?</P>
<P class="p165 ft36"><SPAN class="ft35">A: </SPAN>Effectively, the dude does not help you for determining your total stud or draw bonus. (S)he can still be chosen as a casualty though.</P>
<P class="p44 ft11"><A href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041026234032/http://www.gamesmeister.com/doomtown/faq.htm#top">Top</A></P>
<P class="p22 ft54">Draw vs Stud</P>
<P class="p166 ft23">A dude can only ever be either a Draw or a Stud - these Bullet types are mutually exclusive. Therefore, if there are two abilities, one saying "Bob is a Stud", and the other saying "Bob is a Draw", the two effects cancel each other out, and the dude will be whatever bullet type he would otherwise have been. Note that an 'ability' is not an a action - both are card effects, but an action is a card effect preceded by 'Noon', 'Shootout', or 'Reaction', and an ability is any other card effect.</P>
<P class="p29 ft55">Examples of these abilities are:</P>
<P class="p34 ft37"><SPAN class="ft2">Pearl Handled Revolver </SPAN>This dude is a Stud in a Shootout.</P>

<P class="p177 ft7">For Austin, the PHR nullifies The Jinx and KK's effect nullifies the PW. He remains a Stud. Katie has no defense against either effect (note than her effect doesn't include keeping herself as a Stud), so she is a Draw.</P>

<P class="p22 ft16">Jobs</P>
<P class="p181 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Do I have to defend against a job, or can I just let it succeed without putting up a fight <SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>You are never forced to defend, and sometimes it's a good idea not to, particularly if you could lose a lot of Dudes in a shootout.</P>
<P class="p46 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>When I nominate a Dude to start a Job, does that Dude have to be part of the posse going on the job or can the other dudes do the Job without him.</P>
<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>He must always go along</P>
<P class="p182 ft43"><SPAN class="ft42">Q: </SPAN>If an effect prevents the nominated dude from performing an action, such as Mob Justice or Singing Feather, what happens?</P>
<P class="p183 ft63"><SPAN class="ft62">A: </SPAN>The job does not start, as the action is cancelled before posses are formed. <SPAN class="ft62">Q: </SPAN>Can a booted dude start a job that does not require the Dealer to boot?</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_16">


<P class="p0 ft12"><SPAN class="ft46">A: </SPAN>No. As of Boot Hill, only unbooted dudes can start jobs.</P>
<P class="p30 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Can I target my own cards with jobs?</P>
<P class="p184 ft7"><SPAN class="ft18">A: </SPAN>Mostly yes, but the exception is Dudes - you can't target Dudes you control with your own job.</P>
<P class="p35 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>So if I own a strike that's controlled by another player, and I want to Arson it, who forms the defending posse?</P>
<P class="p185 ft20"><SPAN class="ft19">A: </SPAN>The controller of a card always has first choice to defend it. If he or she opts not to defend, then the owner of the card can do so instead. So in the above example, if the controlling player opts not to defend, you can choose not to as well and the Arson will automatically succeed.</P>
<P class="p42 ft25"><SPAN class="ft24">Q: </SPAN>I start a job at an opponent's Deed, and we both form posses. In the middle of the shootout, one of us plays a card effect that sends both posses home booted. Is the job successful?</P>
<P class="p58 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A</SPAN>: No, if the Dealer doesn't have a posse left standing at the location of the Job when it's over, the Job fails.</P>
<P class="p86 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>What about if my posse never even makes it to the target location, due to some devious trick played by my opponent. What happens to the job then?</P>
<P class="p186 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A</SPAN>: If you don't have a posse, there's no shootout and the job will automatically fail. <SPAN class="ft43">However, as long as at least one dudes arrives at the target location, the job continues, even if the Dealer gets Lost in the Badlands.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p187 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q</SPAN>: Some cards, like the <SPAN class="ft41">Stained Glass Window</SPAN>, move a shootout to another location. If that happens during a job, does the job still succeed if the target loses the shootout?</P>
<P class="p162 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A</SPAN>: As above, the answer's no. For a job to succeed, the Dealer has to have the sole surviving posse at the original target location. So if I tried to <SPAN class="ft37">Arson </SPAN>your <SPAN class="ft37">St. Martin's Chapel</SPAN>, and you threw me through your <SPAN class="ft37">Stained Glass Window </SPAN>into the Town Square, the job would fail even if I won the shootout.</P>
<P class="p170 ft25"><SPAN class="ft24">Q: </SPAN>But what if the target was a Dude? If the Dude got thrown into the Town Square as well, presumably the shootout is still taking place in the target location, and so can succeed.</P>
<P class="p188 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Once again, that's a no. The target location is determined when the job is declared, and doesn't change even if the Dude moves elsewhere.</P>
<P class="p189 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>The rulebook says third parties involved in a job can play Shootout Actions. What about Reactions?</P>
<P class="p190 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Sure. You can play reactions that don't require you to have a draw hand (which is most of them). So, for example, Nice Boots Chief and Fanning the Hammer are both fine (you don't have to have a Draw hand to play them), whereas Quickdraw is out. For more information, see the Reactions List <A href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041026234032/http://www.gamesmeister.com/doomtown/reactions.htm"><SPAN class="ft64">here</SPAN></A></P>
<P class="p191 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q</SPAN>: If a third player includes one or more of his Dudes in my Job's posse, can I choose one of those Dudes as my shooter?</P>
<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A</SPAN>: Yes, absolutely</P>
<P class="p37 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q</SPAN>: So presumably I'll get Draw bonuses for all his or her other Dudes that have joined my posse too?</P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A</SPAN>: Correct.</P>
<P class="p192 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q</SPAN>: When I declare a job using an Action card, do I discard the card immediately or wait till the job finishes? It makes a difference if I have to reshuffle my discard pile to draw my Draw hand. <SPAN class="ft22">A</SPAN>: Wait until the job completes before discarding the card..</P>

<P class="p194 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Does card memory apply to Goods? For example, if I give a Goods a permanent +1 Bullet bonus, does that apply to all copies of the Goods when they come into play?</P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>No, the only time card memory applies to a Goods card is if it's unique.</P>
<P class="p195 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>My Dude has his value reduced to less than an Ace which aces him, and then somehow returns from the grave. When he comes back into play, does he immediately explode again? <SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>No, he returns with a value of Ace.</P>

<P class="p27 ft16">Cheatin’</P>
<P class="p196 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Say I’m in a shootout and I cheat. Can <SPAN class="ft22">anyone </SPAN>in the game play a cheatin' card on me, or only my opponent in the shootout?</P>
<P class="p197 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Anyone, but only once on each Draw. Multiple players can't hit you on the same Draw, even if your hand is replaced with a new one.</P>
<P class="p198 ft25"><SPAN class="ft24">Q: </SPAN>If my hand has less then 5 cards for some reason, is it considered a cheatin' hand? <SPAN class="ft24">A: </SPAN>Nope, there’s nothing in the rules about having a full sized hand. That is not cheatin.</P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>Can cheatin' cards be used in the lowball hand?</P>
<P class="p199 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Sure, but remember they do exactly as specified. In other words, they do not do the "opposite" of what they say simply because it's the lowball hand. (Cheatin' varmint does not increase a hand by 3 ranks)</P>
<P class="p55 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q</SPAN>: If I have a Cheatin' hand, but a card effect changes the rank of that hand, say from a Five of a Kind to a Dead Man's Hand, is my hand still considered to be Cheatin'?</P>
<P class="p200 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A</SPAN>: Yes, you still have two or more cards in your hand with identical values. <A href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041026234032/http://www.gamesmeister.com/doomtown/faq.htm#top"><SPAN class="ft64">Top</SPAN></A></P>

</DIV>
<DIV id="page_18">


<P class="p202 ft25"><SPAN class="ft24">A: </SPAN>Whenever you draw a poker hand, you are drawing for a single hand. No matter how many times you modify the hand, or even discard it and redraw it, you are still just drawing cards for the same hand. Therefore you only 'reveal' the hand once.This means there is only one point in time when you can play reactions that occur before a hand is revealed, one point when you can play reactions that occur when a hand is revealed, and the same again for reactions that occur after the hand is revealed.

<P class="p204 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>If I have the <NOBR>experienced-Harrowed</NOBR> Northrop in play and I replace him with the inexperienced, does the inexperienced get in play as normal, or is he a harrowed inexperienced Northrop?</P>
<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>The inexperienced one enters play normally and is NOT harrowed. Strange, but true...</P>
<P class="p205 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>What if I'd given the experienced Northrop a Harrowed power, and then replace him with the inexperienced version. Does he keep the Harrowed power, even though he's no longer Harrowed?</P>
<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A</SPAN>: Yes, it's a permanent change to the Dude and therefore remains through card memory.</P>
<P class="p206 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q</SPAN>: Say I've got a <NOBR>non-unique</NOBR> Dude in play, and my opponent also has a copy. I switch in an experienced version who is also unique. What happens to my opponent's Dude?</P>
<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A</SPAN>: Nothing happens to him, he remains in play.</P>
<P class="p207 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>If a Dude has goods or Spells, and is replaced by a different version, are they discarded? <SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>No, he keeps them.</P>
<P class="p208 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>If two players try to start with different versions of the same dude, do they still have to make the pull to see who starts with him.</P>
<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>If both versions are unique, yes, otherwise no.</P>
<P class="p209 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>The rulebook explains how to replace a dude in play with an Experienced version of that same dude (or <NOBR>vice-versa).</NOBR> It does not, however, address card orientation (booted vs. unbooted). <SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>It remains whatever it was before the switch.</P>
<P class="p210 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>What do the rules mean when they say "Different versions of a dude are considered the same dude for deckbuilding"?</P>
<P class="p211 ft20"><SPAN class="ft19">A: </SPAN>It means you can only have a total of 4 copies of that dude in your deck, regardless of what version you include. For example, if you have 2 copies of the inexperienced Nate Hunter, and 2 copies of the experienced version, you can't include any more copies of Nate in your deck.</P>
<P class="p212 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Can I take control of an opponent's Deed then switch it with another version? If so, am I considered the owner?</P>
<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>Yes you can, but ownership hasn't changed - it's still owned by your opponent.</P>
<P class="p121 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Some <NOBR>non-unique</NOBR> Dudes have experienced versions that are unique. What happens if two players have a copy of the <NOBR>non-unique</NOBR> inexperienced version out, and one wants to bring in the experienced, unique one?</P>
<P class="p42 ft20"><SPAN class="ft19">A: </SPAN>Yeah, this one's confusing. You can bring the experienced version of the Dude in because there isn't another unique version in play to prevent it. The <NOBR>non-unique</NOBR> versions are unaffected when you do this, but you can't now make any of them experienced unless the first one is</P>

<P class="p112 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A</SPAN>: No - this is a common mistake. The Harrowed pull does <SPAN class="ft22">not </SPAN>stop a Dude being aced, it just changes his destination. So instead of going to Boot Hill, the aced Dude goes to discard or home instead.</P>

<P class="p217 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Do harrowed dudes who have been discarded after a shootout retain their harrowed status through card memory?</P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>Yes.</P>
<P class="p218 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>So, just so's I'm completely sure about this, who is acing the Harrowed dude? And does the player who aces a Harrowed dude always makes the Harrowed pull?</P>
<P class="p219 ft7"><SPAN class="ft18">A: </SPAN>The loser chooses the dudes to be aced, then the winner aces them and gets to make the Harrowed Pull.</P>
<P class="p85 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>If I give an experienced Harrowed Dude a Harrowed Power, and then replace him with an inexperienced <NOBR>non-Harrowed</NOBR> version, does he keep the Harrowed Power.</P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>Yes, it's a permanent change and remains through Card Memory</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>And when am I supposed to make that Harrowed pull?</P>
<P class="p67 ft17">A: <SPAN class="ft2">The timing of the Harrowed pull occurs </SPAN>after all other reactions to the dude being aced<SPAN class="ft2">.</SPAN></P>

<P class="p27 ft16">Influence</P>
<P class="p220 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Some Dudes say "[This Dude's] Influence does not add to your total during Nightfall. Does that mean it doesn't count for control of Deeds either?</P>
<P class="p221 ft7"><SPAN class="ft18">A: </SPAN>No, it just means it's not included in your overall total, used for checking Victory Conditions and to see who gets the extra card.</P>
<P class="p222 ft16">Jokers</P>
<P class="p223 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q</SPAN>: Can I use a Joker to make a Dead Man's Hand, or does it have to be the exact 5 cards? <SPAN class="ft17">A</SPAN>: Yep, you can use a Joker.</P>
<P class="p56 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q</SPAN>: My final Draw hand consists of 4 Queens (one of each suit) and a Joker. If I say the Joker is a Queen to give myself a 5 of a kind, does that make my hand illegal?</P>
<P class="p197 ft7"><SPAN class="ft18">A</SPAN>: No. It's true that you have to declare the value and suit of your Joker, but a Joker itself never makes a Draw hand illegal.</P>
<P class="p85 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>When do I declare the value of a Joker? This makes a difference for card effects that affect particular hand ranks, such as a Dead Man's Hand.</P>
<P class="p224 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>You don't need to declare it until after all reactions to the Draw hand have been played, just before you compare hand ranks.</P>
<P class="p205 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>The Joker says it can be any value. Does that literally mean <SPAN class="ft17">any </SPAN>value? e.g. the 100 of clubs? <SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>No, it has to be a legal card value, between Ace and King.</P>

<P class="p27 ft16">Kung Fu Powers</P>
<P class="p152 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q</SPAN>: So how do these work?</P>
<P class="p225 ft7"><SPAN class="ft18">A</SPAN>: Pretty much the same as Harrowed powers actually, instead they're attached to Kung Fu dudes instead of harrowed dudes..</P>
<P class="p226 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q</SPAN>: So can a Kung Fu Dude be targeted with more than one copy of a Kung Fu power? <SPAN class="ft22">A</SPAN>: No, like Harrowed powers, a dude can only have one copy of each.</P>

<P class="p22 ft16">Maximum Hand Size</P>
<P class="p227 ft25"><SPAN class="ft24">Q: </SPAN>What is the maximum hand size? (Maybe I missed it but it doesn't seem obvious anywhere.) <SPAN class="ft24">A: </SPAN><SPAN class="ft33">There is no limit to the number of cards you can have in your play hand. At nightfall, and sometimes due to other card effects, you refill your hand to what is referred to as your maximum hand size. This starts the game at 5 cards, and can be modified by other cards.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p228 ft7"><SPAN class="ft18">Q: </SPAN>So if a card lets me redraw back up to my maximum hand size, and I have the most Influence, do I include the extra card when I redraw?</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_21">


<P class="p229 ft7"><SPAN class="ft18">A: </SPAN>No. The extra card for having the highest influence is a bonus card that's only drawn during Nightfall. <SPAN class="ft36">After you refill your hand normally.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p230 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q</SPAN>: Do I have to draw the extra card? <SPAN class="ft22">A</SPAN>: Yes you do.</P>
<P class="p199 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>If I have degenerated my deck and discard piles down to a total of 5 cards, and I have no cards left in my hand, can I choose not to draw any cards?</P>
<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>No, you <SPAN class="ft17">must </SPAN>draw back up to 5 cards (or your maximum hand size if it's not 5) if you can</P>

<P class="p27 ft16">Movement Restrictions</P>
<P class="p231 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q</SPAN>: Some cards in the game stop my dudes moving to a location. If one of those targets my home, can I still boot to go home, or did I get locked out without my keys?</P>
<P class="p232 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A</SPAN>: Whenever you move home booted, you override movement restrictions. Doesn't matter why your dude went home, whether voluntarily through normal movement, through chickening out, through his deed being aced etc. Any time that a dude boots to go home, he cannot be prevented. Note the importance of the booting bit. You can't Shadow Walk to a restricted home, because you're not booting.</P>
<P class="p233 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>These movement restrictions stop my Dudes moving to a location, right? Does that just mean using the noon Movin' action, or is it any form of movement?</P>
<P class="p234 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Any time a Dude changes location for any reason that Dude is considered to be moving. This includes moving to join a posse, being a part of a posse that moves to another location, moving using a Horse or a Gadget, etc. As a result, any effects which restrict the movement of a Dude always restrict the movement of that Dude.</P>
<P class="p177 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>If I want to bring a Token Dude into a shootout at a location with movement restrictions, can I do that?</P>
<P class="p235 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Yes. Bringing a Dude into play at a location is not the same as moving a Dude to that location, which means you can ignore any movement restrictions.</P>

<P class="p222 ft16">Reactions</P>
<P class="p34 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q</SPAN>: Reactions - ugh! I'm confused about the timing of 'em - please help!</P>
<P class="p128 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A</SPAN>: Yeah, this can be tricky at first, so we'll take it a step at a time. First off, all reactions have a trigger - this must occur for the reaction to be played. For example, take a look at the action <SPAN class="ft37">Only Winged 'Em. </SPAN>It states "<SPAN class="ft37">Play when a Dude is aced.</SPAN>" That means you can't play this card until a Dude is aced, and if you wish to play it, you must do so at the time the Dude is aced - you can't leave it till later.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_22">


<P class="p237 ft25"><SPAN class="ft24">Q</SPAN>: Ok, I understand that, but the wording on some of the reactions is different. For example, you mention <SPAN class="ft38">Only Winged 'Em, </SPAN>but I'm now looking at <SPAN class="ft38">And Stay Down! </SPAN>That says "<SPAN class="ft38">Play immediately before a Harrowed Dude is aced</SPAN>". So does that mean it gets played before <SPAN class="ft38">Only Winged 'Em </SPAN>(assuming the Dude who's been aced was Harrowed of course)?</P>
<P class="p238 ft67"><SPAN class="ft66">A</SPAN>: That's right - the wording on these reactions is important. Reactions that occur 'immediately before' a trigger are played and resolve before reactions that occur 'when' a trigger occurs, and these in turn are played and resolve before reactions that are triggered 'after' something happens.</P>
<P class="p154 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q</SPAN>: Right, gotcha. So that means them Cheatin'! cards must occur before most of the other reactions to Draw hands, 'cos Cheatin' cards are played when a hand is revealed whereas cards like Ace In The Hole and Bluff are played after.</P>
<P class="p70 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A</SPAN>: That's exactly right. In fact, if I were to use Ace In The Hole to place a second Ace of Spades into my Draw hand, you can't touch me with a Cheatin'! card, because the time to play it has now passed.</P>
<P class="p239 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q</SPAN>: Seems ok, so here's my last question. In our earlier example with the Dude who's been aced, let's say it's your Dude who's been aced. I want to play <SPAN class="ft37">Nice Boots Chief</SPAN>, which says "<SPAN class="ft37">Play when an opposing Dude is aced in a shootout</SPAN>".You announce that you want to use <SPAN class="ft37">Only Winged 'Em</SPAN>. Both of these reactions occur at the same time, so what happens?</P>
<P class="p59 ft20"><SPAN class="ft19">A</SPAN>: Whenever 2 or more players want to play a Reaction at the same time, the Winner (that is, the player who won the lowball poker hand) goes first, followed by the player to his or her left and continuing clockwise.To see what happens, take another look at the text of the two cards</P>
<P class="p240 ft69">Nice Boots Chief <SPAN class="ft68">Reaction</SPAN>: Play when an opposing Dude is aced in a shootout. Take a Goods from that Dude and attach it to one of your Dudes that was in the shootout.</P>
<P class="p241 ft41">Only Winged 'Em <SPAN class="ft70">Reaction</SPAN>: Play when a Dude is aced. The Dude is not aced, but is discarded instead.</P>
<P class="p139 ft23">If you were the Winner, you play your card first, so you take the chosen Goods card and attach it to your Dude. Then I play mine, and my Dude is discarded instead of aced, going to my discard pile instead of Boot Hill. So far so good, but the situation changes significantly if I was the winner. In that case, I play my card first, which changes the status of the Dude to <NOBR>not-aced.</NOBR> That means that when it's your turn to play your reaction, you can no longer play it because the trigger no longer exists (there is no longer an aced Dude). That's why winning lowball is so important!</P>

<P class="p106 ft16">Skill Check</P>
<P class="p242 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>If I have to make skill check, say for a spell, but I've completely run out of cards in both my deck and discard pile, what happens? Does the spell automatically fail?</P>
<P class="p59 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>No. For a spell to succeed, the skill plus pull must be greater than the difficulty. If there's no pull, just compare skill vs difficulty.</P>

<P class="p27 ft16">Statistics Modifications</P>
<P class="p243 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>Card Stats. If a card effect reduces influence or bullets below 0, it just reduces them to 0 right?</P>
<P class="p32 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>Unless specified, a stat can go below 0, but whenever you check the stat, it is counted as a 0.</P>
<P class="p244 ft16">Targeting</P>
<P class="p106 ft16">Token Dudes</P>
<P class="p245 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>If I have a card effect that requires me to boot a Dude, can I select one of my token Dudes to 'boot'?</P>
<P class="p112 ft67"><SPAN class="ft66">A: </SPAN>Yes. While a token Dude is in play, it's treated just like any other Dude. It can boot, unboot, be targeted with actions, and anything else that can happen to a normal Dude during a shootout.</P>
<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>So does that mean they can become wanted?</P>
<P class="p28 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>Sure, if they join a posse on someone else's Private land.</P>
<P class="p29 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>And when exactly do these token Dudes leave play?</P>
<P class="p246 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>As soon as the shootout in which they were generated ends. So if the shootout lasts for three rounds, and a token Dude is aced in the first round, the Dude goes to Boot Hill until the end of the third round at which point it disappears from play.</P>
<P class="p132 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>If I want to bring a Token Dude into a shootout at a location with movement restrictions, can I do that?</P>
<P class="p247 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Yes. Bringing a Dude into play at a location is not the same as moving a Dude to that location, which means you can ignore any movement restrictions.</P>
<P class="p248 ft2"><SPAN class="ft17">Q: </SPAN>What about if I'm in a shootout that no other Dudes can join - can I bring a token Dude in? <SPAN class="ft17">A: </SPAN>No. They are treated like normal Dudes, and cannot join the posse.</P>
<P class="p249 ft23"><SPAN class="ft22">Q: </SPAN>If I bring a Token Dude into play, does he belong to my outfit? <SPAN class="ft22">A: </SPAN>Nope. All Token Dudes are drifters.</P>
<P class="p189 ft43"><SPAN class="ft42">Q: </SPAN>Aren't all token dudes unique? Doesn't this mean I can't create more than one at the same time?</P>
<P class="p85 ft73"><SPAN class="ft72">A: </SPAN>Nope. This rules is slightly confusing, but "Buckets", etc can create as many dudes as you wish; each is a separate, unique dude. You can have more than one in play at once.</P>

<P class="p65 ft36"><SPAN class="ft35">A: </SPAN>No. Unready weapons have no effect on play, so you can use actions such as TC's shootout action.</P>
<P class="p251 ft43"><SPAN class="ft42">Q: </SPAN>If a ready weapon is removed from a dude, when does that dude ready a different weapon? <SPAN class="ft42">A: </SPAN>Automatically. If the dude has more than one unready weapon, choose one. This does not require an action.</P>
<P class="p252 ft12"><SPAN class="ft46">Q: </SPAN>What if it's during a shootout</P>
<P class="p117 ft43"><SPAN class="ft42">A: </SPAN>As long as the weapon has not been used during that shootout, ready a new weapon immediately. If the dude has used a weapon this shootout, then you need another card effect to ready a different weapon. eg. Just What I need.</P>
