OK to put some thoughts here

I think the classifications of"good", "evil","chaotic" and "orderly" are far too vague, not to mention cliché to the extreme. No human being sees themselves as "evil". No human being sees themselves as "chaotic" (in the context of  morality, not whimsyness)

Human behaviour generally tends to work around these basic concepts

* [b]Self-Sacrifice and a drive to help others.[/b] This is what is typically characterized as "good" in simplistic morality systems like D&D. It is there people who you will see jumping into the fire to save a child in danger. It the people who will also rob a bank and become outlawys so that they can share the money with the poor.

* [b]Materialistic Self-Interest and/or a lust for power.[/b] While this often makes the person look "evil", people do not see themselves as such. A Materialist will poison the ground water of a nearby village via extensive mining, but they will it as their right use it. A person with a lust for power, will not see killing off their henchman as an evil act, but an act of self-defence against someone about to betray them. 

Side Note: It is important here to make sure that you do not use "insanity" as an easy way to create a villain. Someone who is evil because they're just "mad". People with mental disorders can be seen to act "evil" just as much as they can act "good", and it's the latter far more than it's the former. If you need to include people with mental disorders, it needs to be done with research respect to people with actual such issues, just as you would do if you included People of Color.

* Respect for Authority and authority figures. These are people who work better when they belong in a hierarchy, either at the top of the bottom. A lawful person will follow the orders from authority because it "works better for all" and thus it's the right thing to have.  The law man who reports a colleague who used their position to abuse an outlaw is one such example, but so is the citizen which reports where the escaped slaves are hiding to the looking authorities. Such a person does not have to recognise all authority, as long as they recognise some. The fascist who breaks the law to attack an immigrant because their leaders commands it is also an authoritarian.

* [b]Drive for maximum personal liberty.[/b] The opposite of an authoritarian, these people prefer to make their own mind about what is right and wrong but do not necessarily see themselves as chaotic. Such a person will disregard a law when they think it is unfair or wrong and will act in accord to it on their own volition. Such a libertarian may be the nomadic black market merchant who refuses to pay taxes because they do not want to fund a state-supported war, and it can be the outlaw who sabotages
