True Doomtown is a collection of decks, one for each outfit that are meant to be played against each other. These should be considered as the "official" inroductory decks of OCTGN Doomtown.

All these decks are "Bicycle" which in layman's terms means that they are completely poker legal - one card per suit & rank. As a result you cannot make Cheatin' hands while bullet ranks of dudes actually are much more important, as there are no "shootout" decks making flushes and five of a kinds with 2 brass bullets. Furthermore, not only are there are no duplicate cards making combos that much more difficult, but these decks take it a step further and do not include a card that any other deck is using. As such, each deck plays completely differently and you will always see new cards and combos being used.

That does not mean that these decks are bland, on the contrary, each has been created around a specific theme which puts the benefits of the outfit to use.

Disclaimer: The idea for True Doomtown was partly* taken from [this discussion](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/376556/the-doomtown-game) and decks and in fact, the Law Dogs, Black Jacks, Collegium and Whateley decks are modified versions of the decks created there (*Partly because I was planning to create a bicycle deck for each faction and distribute it, but I got the idea of using each card only once from there). However unlike the ideas there, I did not shy from using all available cards including promos, since in online play, there are no rarity limitations. As such, the decks are more varied and I have more cards at my disposal to make good combos. This means that the decks are not the same as you find in that thread and I have of course a lot of more of them. Nevertheless, credit where credit is due.

Below is a short explanation for each available deck
----

Lawdogs - Hunter's Office: Build your dudes' bullet rating, equip them with shotguns and blast the opposition before bullets even start flying. As a law dog, you find making dudes wanted easy and from there, you hound them down.

Blackjacks: Use your multiple of jobs to keep your opponent on their toes and your horses to outmaneuver them. If they dare to get into shootouts, use all the dirty tricks in the book to make sure they regret it.

Collegium - The New Front: Build up you destructive capacity with gadget weapons and go to town to anyone unfortunate to stand against you. You'll make them run scared from your nerds with weird guns.

Whateleys - Extended Family: Use your expendable abominations to keep the opposition at bay until you save enough money to plop down Grimley's Manor at just the right spot. Then just reduce their influence with spells and watch them despair.

The Agency - Union Blue: Gather around The Tree and built it with gadgets and improvements to the point where everyone starts hiding outside of town for fear of your dudes sitting there. Then simply start picking them off with jobs and rooftop snipers at your leisure.

Lost Angels: Control the city's entertainment by bying all Saloons and Brothers.Defend your property with the nastiest mystical goods boosted with your miracles.

The Flock - Children of the Armegeddon: Make your opponent's dudes wanted, take them over with with your spells, events and actions and sacrifice them for your own benefit. And if that's not possible, just bring in the lode and make sure nobody can stay there long enough to disrupt your plans.

Maze Rats - Iron Dragon: Dazzle them with hexes and then punch them in the face with some Kung-Fu. And if your opponents make the mistake of relying to weapons, they'll soon find out that they're no use.

Sweetrock - Western Corporate Offices: "If they won't sell out, burn them out!." Deny your opponent resources while you build up your mines. Control the city while they are starving for ghost rock.

Texas Tangers - Dixie Rails: Bring in your unstoppable harrowed and make your opponent pull their hair out in frustration as your dudes refuse to stay dead.

Sioux Union: Reduce their value and bullets and then get into shootouts just long enough to fill them full of arrows and lightning. If that fails, just run back and fight another day.
